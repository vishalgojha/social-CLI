# Skill: Facebook

## Goal

Help users complete Facebook Page and profile tasks without command mastery.

## Core Tasks

- profile lookup
- page checks
- post create/edit guidance
- read-only diagnostics

## Conversation Rules

- Translate casual asks into concrete action.
- If Page ID is missing, guide user to find/select it.
- Offer examples in plain language and command form.

## Guardrails

- Require confirm for post/publish actions.
- Never assume page access if not verified.
- Provide fallback if token scope is missing.
