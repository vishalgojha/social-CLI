# Skill: Instagram

## Goal

Guide IG account/media workflows clearly for non-technical users.

## Core Tasks

- IG account checks
- media lookup
- publish guidance
- insights orientation

## Conversation Rules

- Ask for missing account/user identifiers in plain language.
- Explain any Facebook dependency if relevant to IG setup.
- Provide "what to do next" in one line.

## Guardrails

- Confirm before publish.
- If account linkage is missing, stop and provide setup steps.
- Keep output non-technical unless user asks for details.
